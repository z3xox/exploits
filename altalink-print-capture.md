## Summary: 
> The "https://example.com/properties/security/network_troubleshooting_log.php" normally allows accounts with diagnostic privileges to access diagnostic features that allow them to find any problems related to ports such as HTTP, HTTPS and LDAP but an attacker could take advantage of this issue by customizing the port that the printer is listening to a printing port such as 9100 (Raw Printing), 631 (IPP) and 515 (LPR) which would enable the printer to capture all traffic of the given ports and store them to the machine internal storage for up to 48 hours. After capturing the data, the attacker simply downloads the pcap file and opens it in a network protocol analyzer program such as “WireShark” and listen to the TCP conversation and extracts them. Finally, using the extracted TCP conversation the attacker can use a tool which converts PostScript file to PDF such as “GhostScript”
